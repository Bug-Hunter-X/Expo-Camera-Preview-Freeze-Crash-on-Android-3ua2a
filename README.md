# Expo Camera Preview Freeze/Crash on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the preview can freeze or crash on certain Android devices. The issue is particularly noticeable when switching between cameras or rapidly adjusting settings. The problem is intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently across devices.

## Bug Description

The Expo Camera preview freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes. No specific error messages are usually logged. The issue seems to be related to memory management or resource contention on Android.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Install the Expo Go app on an affected Android device.
2. Run the `bug.js` example.
3. Observe the preview; switching between cameras or frequently altering settings may trigger the crash.

## Potential Solutions (See `bugSolution.js`)

Several approaches may mitigate the problem, including:

*   **Improved Memory Management:** Implementing techniques to free up camera resources promptly.
*   **Camera Permissions:** Ensuring necessary permissions are handled correctly.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage unexpected behaviors.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Executing camera-related operations asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.

## Solution Details

The `bugSolution.js` file provides example implementations to address potential causes of the problem.  These are illustrative examples; optimal solutions depend heavily on your app's architecture and usage patterns.
