This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices. The preview freezes or crashes, and the camera becomes unresponsive. This is particularly noticeable when switching between cameras (front and back) or changing camera settings frequently. The error is not consistently reproducible across devices, making debugging challenging.  The problem seems linked to memory management or resource contention on the Android platform, but no specific error messages are logged in the console.
